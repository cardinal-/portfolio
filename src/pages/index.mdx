    <p>
      I love solving problems that impact real people. I fell in love with
      design thinking as a framework for what I had been pursuing for most of my
      life without knowing what it was called. I have been fortunate to be a
      part of IBM's design transformation that is headquartered right here in
      Austin, Texas.
