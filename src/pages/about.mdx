        I am a designer with a background in bicycle fabrication and fine art. I
        draw to understand and communicate ideas. When I was young, my curiosity
        and the boredom of long Canadian winters led me to take apart all of my
        toys. This drove my parents nuts, but looking back, I like to think that
        I was researching to improve my understanding of how things were made.

        I have an ability to feel what my users feel and that comes from direct
        observation and a curiousity to dig deeper into what is on the surface.
        Knowing what a person struggles with and what they want to prioritize
        allows me to deliver impactful solutions. I am driven by a desire to
        know that the work I do improves peopleâ€™s lives.
