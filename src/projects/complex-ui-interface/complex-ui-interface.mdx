<ProjectTitle>Complexity control</ProjectTitle>

  <ProjectOverview>
    This was a self directed project. It began through a conversation I was having with a friend about Spotify. When the streaming service was new to me, I felt the complexity of the interface was overwhelming. We talked about issues that arise when you have access to all the music you could ever listen to at your fingertips and yet somehow it is difficult to find the thing you are looking for. The conversation left me thinking about how I might address the complexity of this experience. Putting these ideas onto paper eventually led to my first successful patent submition.

  ## hello

  Applications can have a lot of information in them. I work at a company that specializes in providing tools for users that need to interact with many types of data and many potential ways that they may want to see that data. In a scenario where I have many data items to filter, what if I had the ability to zoom in and out of that complexity, providing a taylored view that is specific to what I want to see? The starting point for this project was a conversation about Spotify and just how overwhelming the volume of information felt.
  
  I wondered what a tailored view would look like? Could the application be smart enough to suggest the things I want to see? Sure we have suggestion engines and in some user experiences these are a fine way to help direct users. I think we are all familiar with the Amazon “people who viewed this also viewed” approach. 
   
  But one key difference that I uncovered with the Spotify example is that so much about music is about discoverability. While talking through the problems with the complexity of the catalog, I also heard that the richness in that volume of options is appealing. The difference is that element of control, or put better by the friend I was sharing coffee with:

    I don’t want to be told what I like. I want to figure it out for myself, so I know it’s real.
